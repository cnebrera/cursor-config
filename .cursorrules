# Cursor AI Rules Configuration
# These rules guide the AI assistant's behavior when working on code

## File Operations
- Don't ask for confirmation on file edits unless the file is outside the project scope
- Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless explicitly required

## Code Quality Standards

### Documentation
- Code must be well documented, including:
  - Class documentation
  - Function/method documentation
  - Variable documentation with meaningful descriptions
  - Internal line comments explaining complex logic
- Use language-specific documentation standards:
  - Javadoc for Java
  - JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Docstrings for Python
  - XML comments for C#
- Always write documentation and comments in English

### Code Structure
- Follow a divide-and-conquer approach
- Keep functions reasonably sized and focused on a single responsibility
- Break down complex functions into smaller, manageable units
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use design patterns appropriately

### Code Quality Principles
- Follow SonarQube quality principles:
  - Avoid code duplication
  - Maintain low cyclomatic complexity
  - Keep function/method length reasonable
  - Avoid deep nesting
  - Follow SOLID principles
- Never provide "quick and dirty" solutions
- Always prioritize maintainability and readability
- Write production-ready code, not prototypes

### Error Handling and Logging
- Implement proper error and exception management
- Ensure all errors are well controlled and properly propagated
- Include appropriate logging at different levels:
  - INFO for important state changes
  - WARN for recoverable issues
  - ERROR for failures
  - DEBUG for troubleshooting information
- Use structured logging when available
- Include contextual information in log messages

### Naming Conventions
- Never use short or abbreviated names for variables or methods
- All naming must be descriptive and self-explanatory
- Use meaningful names that express intent
- Follow language-specific naming conventions:
  - camelCase for Java/JavaScript methods and variables
  - PascalCase for classes
  - snake_case for Python
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Always use English for all code elements (variables, functions, classes, etc.)

## Language Requirements
- All code, comments, documentation, logs, and commit messages must be in English
- Exception messages and user-facing text should also be in English unless specifically required otherwise

## Version Control
- **NEVER perform a commit or push to git without asking first**
- **NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc.) unless explicitly requested**
- **NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (force push, hard reset, etc.) unless explicitly requested**
- **NEVER force push to main/master branches** - warn the user if they request it
- Always provide clear commit messages that explain the changes
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate

## Code Generation Philosophy
- Focus on writing maintainable, scalable, and testable code
- Consider edge cases and potential failure scenarios
- Implement proper input validation
- Use defensive programming techniques
- Optimize for readability first, performance second (unless performance is the explicit goal)
- Include appropriate unit tests when requested or when it makes sense

## Technology Stack Preferences
- Use modern language features and best practices
- Leverage well-established libraries and frameworks
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns

## Additional Guidelines
- When uncertain, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Provide explanations for complex implementations
- Suggest improvements when obvious issues are detected
- Reference documentation or standards when making recommendations
